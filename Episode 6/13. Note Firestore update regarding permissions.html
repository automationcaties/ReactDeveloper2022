<p>There has been a recent update in Firebase's database for new users where by default, there is a permission rule that disables reading from the database after 30 days! If this is not changed, some of you may start to see an error in your application saying <code>FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.</code> </p><p>This can be quickly fixed by navigating to the rules tab in the database of your firestore console. </p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-01-23_12-59-29-e7d47ff716daba6fa334cbe0f6fea0f5.png"></figure><p>You will land on this page, which manages the permissions for your database. We will cover this section in greater depth later in the course. </p><p>The text you can edit, and the part to focus on is line 4 and 5:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-01-23_13-06-17-e3af9771c13c0032b3a61c64b85ea375.png"></figure><p>If you do not see <code>request.time &lt; timestamp.date(year, month, day);</code> on line 5, you don't need to worry about this. If you do, just remove it, and replace the <code>: if</code> with a <code>;</code> on line 4. </p><p>Your final result should look like:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-01-23_13-07-01-6c96157500d57e0b3ea02df4027673a4.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>With that you should be good to continue on!</p><p>Happy coding :)</p>
