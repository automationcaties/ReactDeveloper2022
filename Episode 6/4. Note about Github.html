<p>In the upcoming lessons, we will be adding firebase to our React application. One thing to note is that we will be adding a config object that we get from firebase into our files, and in that config object is an API key. Typically it is good practice not to expose your API key publicly, but in the case of firebase, we have to do so because this is how firebase knows the application is ours! This is perfectly safe, and the intended purpose of this public API key. If you commit your code to Github, you may get a warning from GitGuardian having caught a google key, but GitGuardian has acknowledged that this is not an issue <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=firebase%20api%20key%20gitguardian&amp;src=typd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p><br></p><p>How we secure our data is actually done with security rules in the firebase dashboard, but we will cover that in a later lesson! So please continue the course without worry :)</p>
