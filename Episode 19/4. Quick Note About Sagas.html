<p>These next few videos are going to be tough. Keep in mind that getting redux-sagas in one go is usually impossible and it is something you practice multiple times to fully understand. We highly recommend you code along in this section and pause or rewatch the videos whenever you feel unsure of something. Another option is to watch this section all the way through, then come back the 2nd time around and code along once you have a general idea of the concepts. <br><br>Good luck!</p>
