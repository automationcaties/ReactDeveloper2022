<p>Over the next couple of videos we are going to be covering some specific Firebase commands. Keep in mind that as a React Developer, you do not need to memorize these things and most of the time you can always refer to the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">firebase documentation</a> for more information. We decided to include the process in the course so that you get a clear picture into what&nbsp; is involved in creating a full scale application. <br><br>If for some reason you get overwhelmed with Firestore, just keep going and use our provided code since this is not the "important" part of the course. </p>
