<p>The coding challenge is to move your cart for any signed in user into firebase! Key things to consider here include:</p><p>- What happens if a user isn't signed in and adding items to the cart? Do we still fire off a request to update a cart in firebase?</p><p>- What happens when users sign out/ sign in? Should we pull that users cart from firebase into our application?</p><p>- When should we create the users cart document in firebase?</p><p>- What security rules do I need to set up for carts in firebase?</p><p>This challenge will bring together everything we've learned in this course, but I would like to point you towards certain resources that will help you in building this feature!</p><p>We will probably have to query against a carts collection (i.e. we need to enable list in security rules) in firebase for a specific cart that is related to our user. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data#get_multiple_documents_from_a_collection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">We will need the where() query</a> as well as an understanding of using the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-conditions#data_validation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resource and data keyword in our firebase security rules</a>.</p><p>If you get stuck or have completed your solution, you can compare it to mine in the following repo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/crwn-clothing-firebase-cart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/crwn-clothing-firebase-cart</a></p><p><br></p><p>Happy coding!</p>
