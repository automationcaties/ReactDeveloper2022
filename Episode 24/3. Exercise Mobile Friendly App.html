<p>As a bonus exercise for those that want to try, you can continue to play around with our shopping application and customize it to your liking on mobile! Beyond that, from this point forward, you can customize and add any additional features you want in this app. As with any programming project, the opportunities to improve upon it are endless. <br><br>The rest of the sections&nbsp; will close out some of the lessons we learned, as well as introduce you to some bonus topics like <strong>Testing</strong> and <strong>PWAs</strong>&nbsp;(we will even convert our master project to a PWA so all of these mobile changes we made will now make our app behave like a mobile app), but are only optional for you to take. Enjoy!</p>
