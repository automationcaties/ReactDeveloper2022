If you are curious which font I'm using inside of VSCode, it is a font called "Operator Mono Lig". I have included a zip file in the resources folder which has the font. </p><p><em>*Please only use this font (Operator Mono) for personal use, the font itself is available free for download online as well for personal use but for commercial or sale, it must be purchased*</em></p><p> To switch your VSCode over to using it, simply unzip the file and install the font on your computer. Then navigate into your editor settings and change your font over to Operator Mono Lig; also make sure to enable font ligatures! Here are the settings in question:</p><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/HPbWvYb/2019-07-14-11-41-34-17ea51980107e01e346d8e856d7b4dce.png"></figure><p>You also need to add the extension snazzy operator in order to enable the cursive, as well as some theme extensions if you want the same colors that I have!

With that, let's continue with our course :) </p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
