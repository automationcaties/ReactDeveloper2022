If you check the console and see a CORS error, it's okay to ignore it! Sometimes jsonplaceholder has minor issues related to this and it resolves itself after some time. It's unfortunate but there's nothing wrong with your code! Just check back on it periodically, it has no impact on your learnings with the rest of the course so please just continue with the lessons!</p><p><br></p><p>Happy coding everyone!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
