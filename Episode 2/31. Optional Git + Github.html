<p>In the next video, we will finally deploy our application online. We will be using Git and Github to do this. However, if you have never used git and Github before, you may want to go to <strong>Appendix 1:&nbsp;Key Developer Concepts</strong> at the bottom of the course video player, and watch the videos titled <em>Git +&nbsp;Github&nbsp; </em>and<em> Git + Github 2</em>. They are both videos from my other course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=FFF295AECF3594CE440E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web Developer in 2019:&nbsp;Zero to Mastery</strong></a><strong> </strong>which I have decided to include for those that need them.<br><br>Otherwise, let's keep going to the next video :)</p>
