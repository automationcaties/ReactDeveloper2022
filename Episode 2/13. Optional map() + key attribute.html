<p>A good rule of thumb as to when to use the <strong>key</strong> attribute you saw in the previous video, is this: <em>Anytime you use the </em><code><em>map() </em></code><em>function inside of render, or you have a list of the same jsx elements one after another, they need a key attribute (and CRA will warn you about it if you miss it)</em><br><br>If you are new to the concept of using the <code>map()</code> function we saw in the previous video and you would like to learn more, we created a bonus video to explain the function in more detail. Simply go to <strong>Appendix 1:&nbsp;Key Developer Concepts</strong> at the bottom of the course video player, and watch the video on the <code>map()</code> function. <br><br>Otherwise, let's keep going to the next video :)</p>
