<p>One more note before continuing! </p><p>There are two ways to connect to a Github repository, through HTTPS and SSH. You can switch between the two options by clicking the switch https/ssh button after clicking clone. HTTPS does not require setup.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-07-05_15-11-12-267a927c0a76196900a0ab31d90c67ad.png"></figure><p>It is recommended by Github to clone using HTTPS according to their <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official documentation here</a>. However, if you do end up using SSH and have never set it up before, there are a couple steps you must take first! </p><p>Firstly, SSH is like a unique fingerprint you generate for your computer in your terminal, which you then let your github account know about so it knows that requests from this computer using SSH (cloning/ pushing/ pulling) are safe to do. </p><p><br></p><p>In order to generate an SSH, please follow the instructions here <a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent</a></p><p><br></p><p>There are Mac and Windows options, so choose the one that's right for you.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-07-05_15-17-27-356a914cbc7dc02e5c764b70d06bc18b.png"></figure><p><strong>If you are unable to deploy to Github Pages in the next video, do not worry!
