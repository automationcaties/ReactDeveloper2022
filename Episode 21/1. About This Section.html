<p>In order to have a fully functioning e commerce project with payments, we need to create a backend server for our Stripe payments. This section coming up does not talk about React, but instead, allows you to have a fully functioning application because our goal here is to have a project as complete as possible for you. However, this is not an important part of the course, so if you do not want to learn about the backend, you can skip this section, or you can just grab the code that we will provide in the last lecture of this section. The only thing you will be missing out on is the full ability to accept payments with Stripe (since currently the payment info the user sends on the frontend isn't doing anything). <br><br>Remember, this section is completely optional!</p>
