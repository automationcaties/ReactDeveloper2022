<p>Hello everyone! In the next lesson, we are going to use a method called <code>compose</code> that we import from <code>'react-apollo'</code>. Unfortunately with the recent React-Apollo update to v3.0.0 it's been removed from React-Apollo and is no longer something we can import from this library. Luckily compose was just a copy of lodash's <code>flowRight</code>. Lodash is just a small library that gives us access to a bunch of helper functions, of which <code>flowRight</code> is one of! In the following lesson, anyplace you see <code>compose</code> just use lodash <code>flowRight</code>!</p><p>You can install lodash in your project by adding it as a dependency as follows:</p><p>If you're using yarn:</p><p><code>yarn add lodash</code></p><p>If you're using npm:</p><p><code>npm install lodash</code> </p><p>You can then import flowRight into your file like so:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import { flowRight } from 'lodash';</pre><p>and just replace any place in the lesson where we use <code>compose</code> with <code>flowRight</code>:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">export default compose(
  //...code 
)(CollectionItemContainer);</pre><p>becomes</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">export default flowRight(
  // ...code
)(CollectionItemContainer);</pre><p>You can find out more about this breaking change here as well: <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/3330" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/3330</a>. So push forward with the lesson :)</p>
