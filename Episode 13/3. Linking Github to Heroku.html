<p>If you would like to not manually deploy the the app like we have seen in the previous video every time, and you want the app to redeploy anytime you update MASTER in your github repository, then you can set that up through Heroku by following these steps: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration</a><br><br>However, since we will be working on the project in the next sections, we recommend that you do not do this so that as you code along, even if your website breaks, your current version of the website is still live on Heroku until you decide to redeploy next. </p>
